# TypeScript sample of the de:code 2016 session

I'd like to share a sample code of TypeScript which was created for TypeScript session of the de:code 2016.

**You can see the session video on the Channel 9:<br/>
[TypeScript - Any browser. Any host. Any OS. OpenÂ Source -](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/de-code/2016/DEV-011)**

## This sample code is:

*   Targeted tsc 1.8.10 and ES2015 option.
*   Created as a project for [Visual Studio Code](http://aka.ms/vscode).
*   Needed node.js for debug.

Have fun!<br/>
